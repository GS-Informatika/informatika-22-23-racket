Billy, January 2023

Was poking around the log files of a piece of s**t platform we acquired and are trying to phase out,
and remarkably it's already being hit with the 2038 problem....in 2023....

For some godforsaken reason it stores a timestamp in mariadb for 15years after the record is created,
sooooo looks like records weren't stored of that type since the 19th?
